A minor project, was tasked us after our 1st month of our Internship.

We were tasked to use all the Machine Learning algorithms learnt, and using the Python's modules, making a project based on the given choices. 
I took the Loan Prediction project, as it's usablility was the most. 
Created an interactive User input code, in which any user can input the givne questions answers, and then the model will predict, if the user is allowed for the loan or not.
